Description: Color values in R are often represented as strings of hexadecimal
    colors or named colors.  This package offers fast conversion of 
    these color representations to either an array of RGBA values
    or to the packed integer format used in native rasters.  This fast conversion
    of colors is implemented using an order-preserving minimal perfect hash
    derived from Majewski et al (xxxx) 'A Family of Perfect Hashing Methods'
